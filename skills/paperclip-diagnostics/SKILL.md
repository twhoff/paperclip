# Paperclip Diagnostics

Read-only diagnostic skill for investigating Paperclip agent heartbeat runs, failures, and logs.

## Quick Reference

### Database connection

```bash
PGPASSWORD=paperclip psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 54329 -U paperclip -d paperclip -c "QUERY" 2>&1 | cat
```

Always pipe through `| cat` to avoid pager issues.

## Key Tables

### `heartbeat_runs` — one row per agent invocation

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | uuid | Primary key (also the run ID) |
| `agent_id` | uuid | FK → `agents.id` |
| `company_id` | uuid | FK → `companies.id` |
| `status` | text | `queued`, `running`, `succeeded`, `failed`, `cancelled` |
| `invocation_source` | text | `on_demand`, etc. |
| `error` | text | Human-readable error message |
| `error_code` | text | Machine-readable code (e.g. `adapter_failed`) |
| `exit_code` | integer | Process exit code |
| `signal` | text | Kill signal if applicable |
| `stdout_excerpt` | text | Truncated stdout capture |
| `stderr_excerpt` | text | Truncated stderr capture |
| `started_at` | timestamptz | When the run started |
| `finished_at` | timestamptz | When the run ended |
| `process_pid` | integer | OS process ID |
| `log_store` | text | Always `local_file` |
| `log_ref` | text | Path: `{companyId}/{agentId}/{runId}.ndjson` |

| `log_compressed` | boolean | Whether log is gzipped |
| `usage_json` | jsonb | Token usage / cost metadata |
| `result_json` | jsonb | Structured result from the run |
| `context_snapshot` | jsonb | Snapshot of agent context at run start |
| `retry_of_run_id` | uuid | If this run is a retry, points to original |
| `process_loss_retry_count` | integer | How many times process was lost and retried |

### `heartbeat_run_events` — granular event stream per run

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `run_id` | uuid | FK → `heartbeat_runs.id` |
| `agent_id` | uuid | FK → `agents.id` |
| `seq` | integer | Ordering within a run |
| `event_type` | text | `lifecycle`, `error`, `structured`, `adapter.invoke` |
| `level` | text | `info`, `error`, etc. |
| `message` | text | Event description |
| `payload` | jsonb | Structured event data |

### `activity_log` — high-level audit trail

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `run_id` | uuid | FK → `heartbeat_runs.id` (nullable) |
| `agent_id` | uuid | FK → `agents.id` |
| `action` | text | What happened |
| `entity_type` | text | What was affected |
| `entity_id` | text | ID of affected entity |
| `details` | jsonb | Extra context |

## Log Files (Filesystem)

Runs store full ndjson logs on the Paperclip server filesystem under
the per-instance run-logs root. The default path is:

```
~/.paperclip/instances/<instanceId>/data/run-logs/<companyId>/<agentId>/<runId>.ndjson[.gz]
```

(Override with the `RUN_LOG_BASE_PATH` env var.) The `log_ref` column
in `heartbeat_runs` contains the **relative** path inside that root,
and `log_compressed` indicates whether the file is gzipped.

```bash
# Resolve the active run-logs root for the default instance
RUN_LOG_ROOT="${RUN_LOG_BASE_PATH:-$HOME/.paperclip/instances/default/data/run-logs}"

# Read a specific run's log (handles either .ndjson or .ndjson.gz)
LOG_REF=$(PGPASSWORD=paperclip psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 54329 -U paperclip -d paperclip -tA \
  -c "SELECT log_ref FROM heartbeat_runs WHERE id = '<run-id>'")
F="$RUN_LOG_ROOT/$LOG_REF"
[ -f "$F.gz" ] && zcat "$F.gz" | head -50 || cat "$F" | head -50

# Inspect total disk usage
du -sh "$RUN_LOG_ROOT"
```

Each line is a JSON object: `{ts, stream: "stdout"|"stderr"|"system", chunk}`.

### Retention defaults

The server prunes run logs hourly. Defaults (configurable under
`runLogs.*` in `config.json` or via `PAPERCLIP_RUN_LOG_*` env vars):

| Setting | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `retentionDays` | 14 | Files older than N days are deleted |
| `maxRunBytes` | 50_000_000 | Per-run cap; runaway logs are truncated with a sentinel line |
| `compressOnFinalize` | true | Gzip the file when the run finishes |

If a run log file is missing, fall back to `stdout_excerpt`,
`stderr_excerpt`, and `heartbeat_run_events` (which always live in
the database).

## Instructions

When a user asks about errors, failures, or diagnostics:

### 1. Identify the scope

Ask (or infer) what they want:
- A specific agent's failures?
- A specific run ID?
- Recent failures across all agents?
- A time window?

### 2. Query the database

**Recent failures (all agents):**
```sql
SELECT a.name, hr.status, hr.error_code, LEFT(hr.error, 120) AS error,
       hr.exit_code, hr.finished_at
FROM heartbeat_runs hr
JOIN agents a ON hr.agent_id = a.id
WHERE hr.status = 'failed'
ORDER BY hr.finished_at DESC LIMIT 10;
```

**Failure breakdown by agent:**
```sql
SELECT a.name, count(*) AS failures,
       max(hr.finished_at) AS last_failure
FROM heartbeat_runs hr
JOIN agents a ON hr.agent_id = a.id
WHERE hr.status = 'failed'
GROUP BY a.name ORDER BY failures DESC;
```

**Failure rate per agent (last 7 days):**
```sql
SELECT a.name,
       count(*) FILTER (WHERE hr.status = 'succeeded') AS ok,
       count(*) FILTER (WHERE hr.status = 'failed') AS fail,
       round(100.0 * count(*) FILTER (WHERE hr.status = 'failed') / count(*), 1) AS fail_pct
FROM heartbeat_runs hr
JOIN agents a ON hr.agent_id = a.id
WHERE hr.started_at > now() - interval '7 days'
GROUP BY a.name ORDER BY fail_pct DESC;
```

**Specific run details:**
```sql
SELECT hr.*, a.name AS agent_name
FROM heartbeat_runs hr
JOIN agents a ON hr.agent_id = a.id
WHERE hr.id = '<run-id>';
```

**Events for a run (ordered):**
```sql
SELECT seq, event_type, level, message, payload
FROM heartbeat_run_events
WHERE run_id = '<run-id>'
ORDER BY seq;
```

**Error events only:**
```sql
SELECT a.name, hre.message, hre.payload, hre.created_at
FROM heartbeat_run_events hre
JOIN agents a ON hre.agent_id = a.id
WHERE hre.level = 'error'
ORDER BY hre.created_at DESC LIMIT 20;
```

**Stdout/stderr for a run:**
```sql
SELECT stdout_excerpt, stderr_excerpt
FROM heartbeat_runs WHERE id = '<run-id>';
```

**Activity log for a run:**
```sql
SELECT action, entity_type, entity_id, details
FROM activity_log WHERE run_id = '<run-id>'
ORDER BY created_at;
```

### 3. Check log files (if available)

```bash
RUN_LOG_ROOT="${RUN_LOG_BASE_PATH:-$HOME/.paperclip/instances/default/data/run-logs}"
LOG_REF=$(PGPASSWORD=paperclip psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 54329 -U paperclip -d paperclip -tA \
  -c "SELECT log_ref FROM heartbeat_runs WHERE id = '<run-id>'")
F="$RUN_LOG_ROOT/$LOG_REF"
[ -f "$F.gz" ] && zcat "$F.gz" || cat "$F"
```

### 4. Summarize findings

Present results as a clear summary:
- Which agents failed and why
- Error patterns (repeated error_codes, common exit codes)
- Suggested next steps (retry, config fix, escalate)

## Common Error Codes

| error_code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `adapter_failed` | The adapter process exited non-zero |
| `timeout` | Run exceeded time limit |
| `process_lost` | Process disappeared unexpectedly |
| `cancelled` | Run was manually cancelled |

## Best Practices

- Always join `heartbeat_runs` with `agents` to get human-readable names
- Use `| cat` on all psql commands to avoid pager
- Check `stdout_excerpt` / `stderr_excerpt` before hunting for log files
- Use `heartbeat_run_events` for the most granular error detail
- Filter by time window to keep queries fast on large tables

## When the DB Shows No Error (Server-Side 500s)

If `heartbeat_runs` shows a failed run but the error tables show nothing useful, the real error is in the live server log, not the DB.

### Read the server log

The Paperclip dev server writes structured JSON logs to stdout. Check the terminal running `pnpm dev` (or `pnpm dev:tailscale`) for lines containing `"level":50` (error) near the timestamp of the failed run.

### Auth-related 500s and 401s → load tailscale-jwt-auth

If you see `401 Unauthorized` or a `500` on any Paperclip API call (especially from `pcli` or `pcurl`), load the `/tailscale-jwt-auth` skill. It covers the full auth chain: deployment mode → JWT secret → JWT minting → token usage.

### Known pattern: FK constraint on `activity_log.run_id`

Error signature:
```
insert or update on table "activity_log" violates foreign key constraint
"activity_log_run_id_heartbeat_runs_id_fk"
Key (run_id)=(...) is not present in table "heartbeat_runs"
```

**Cause:** `pcli` generates a JWT with a synthetic `run_id` that was never a real heartbeat run. The server tries to log the action to `activity_log` with this run_id, hitting the FK constraint.

**Fix:** `server/src/services/activity-log.ts` detects the pcli sentinel UUID (`00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`) and nulls it out before insert. A try/catch fallback handles any other synthetic run_id.

**See also:** `/tailscale-jwt-auth` for the full JWT chain explanation.
